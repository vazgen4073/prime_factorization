Create a complete project with Makefile and tests which contains the following function:

std::vector<int> primeFactorize(int n);

The function must return a collection of integers which contains the prime factors of the given number. 
For example, the prime factors of 125 are 5, 5 and 5. The prime factors of 60 are 2, 2, 3 and 5.

std::vector<int> is a dynamic collection of integers which can be filled in using push_back() method using the following code snippet

std::vector<int> result;
result.push_back(value);

The project should not have a main() function. The code should be on GitHub.

Try to cover the function code with tests as good as possible using test-driven development (TDD) approach.

Three rules of TDD:
1. Write production code only to pass a failing unit test.
2. Write no more of a unit test than sufficient to fail (compilation failures are failures).
3. Write no more production code than necessary to pass the one failing unit test.
